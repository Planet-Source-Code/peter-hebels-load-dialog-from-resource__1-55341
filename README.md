### Description

This code load's a dialog from a resouce file, it can also manipulate the controls on the dialog and recieve messages from it using subclassing. There is included one resource file containing a dialog with various controls, also one commoncontrol (slider) and some non-standard buttons.

Just made this for fun and a little experimenting with resource files, hope you like it.

BTW, you need Visual C++ if you want to add dialog's youself or change them. This because VB is only capable to see and compile the dialog resources, not to edit them.
